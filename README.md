# Procesing time

As of current iteration, using 2 chuncks per prompt, each consisting of 4000 tokens with 1000 overlap, it should take around 50 minutes to process the test book used that consist of 266792 characters, using an average time of 90 seconds per request. 

As of the the new iteration, using gemini as the model, it barely takes over a minute to generate a sumary which is a pretty good improvement
